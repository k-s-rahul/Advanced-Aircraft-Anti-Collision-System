 Projects  The Battle of Neighborhoods Jun 2020 â€“ Jul 2020  Project descriptionApplied Data Science Capstone Project:  Selecting the best location to open a Sushi bar in Manhattan, New York.  My client wants to open his business in the Manhattan area, so I focus on that borough during my analysis We define potential neighborhood based on the number of sushi bars which are operating right in each neighborhood Manhattan has full potential but also is a very challenging district to open a business because of high competition New sushi bar should be open in an area that inadequate neighborhood in this way the bar can attract more customers. Therefore, this analysis necessary to ensure that we have enough customers and that we are not so close to other sushi places.
