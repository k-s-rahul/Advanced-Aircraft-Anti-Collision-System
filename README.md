Advanced Aircraft Anti-Collision System using Zigbee Communication and Reporting to Ground Station over Internet of Things (IoT)

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smartphones, sensors, cameras. It is possible to collect massive amount of data for localization and tracking of Aircraft Collisions. An aircraft collision system is designed is to track the signal. Aircraft intelligent system better suits in all areas for tracking signal which is close to the aircraft device. It is necessary to have an intelligent system which identifies collision before it happens and informs the driver to alert or regulate the speed of the aircraft and to move if it is very close to collision.

This project is an advanced wireless communication by which it detects if any aircraft is coming nearer to another aircraft by giving an LED indication as well as buzzer sound. In this project we are using Microcontroller as its Controller.
